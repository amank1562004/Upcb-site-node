    "The economic progress of Uttar Pradesh in the whole of India is also based on the development of agriculture. Despite the huge development in commerce, trade and industry, the contribution of agriculture sector to the gross income of the region is more than 35 percent. Agriculture has consistently become the most widespread sector in terms of providing employment opportunities. About 60 percent of the employment in the region is available in the agricultural sector. While Uttar Pradesh has made remarkable progress in food grains on the one hand and the green revolution has taken place, on the other hand there has been appreciable progress in the production of potatoes and sugar. The region has also made tremendous progress in the production of pulses/oilseeds in the past years.                    Co-operative banks play a leading role in facilitating short-term loans for the farmers of the region for the resources required for agricultural production-fertilizers, seeds, agricultural defense chemicals/equipment, agricultural machinery etc. Along with providing facilities for scientific storage and marketing of their produce to farmers, these banks also arrange financing for supply of essential consumer goods of daily use.": "The economic progress of Uttar Pradesh in the whole of India is also based on the development of agriculture.
